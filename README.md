# George Washington Neural Network
This repository contains a neural network library built from scratch for use in Neural Network courses at
The George Washington University. It is a basic implementation that provides a number of layers, activation
functions, and loss functions for students to explore how networks work at a low level. 

# Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Functionality
The branch "LSTM" is a LSTM model written from scratch with numpy. LSTM functionality implemented by [@zblooms282](https://github.com/zblooms282).
